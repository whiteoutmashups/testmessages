# BACKEND:
It needs a Django backend that only saves the data entered into the text box when they click the button.

It just a DB with one field, that keeps track of all the messages entered into the box.

# FRONTEND:

Can you make the background scale better? Or make the base background totally black? See Trello for example pic

Can you stretch the text input box so it's longer so you can see the full placeholder text?

Can you stylize the button so it looks nicer please? Like bootstrap btn styles or anything nice

# That's all, then deploy to our server. Thanks!
